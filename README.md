Custom New Tab Page
===================
So one day I decided to make a new tab page to use in my Firefox browser.

Here's the files because why not right?

# Features:
* Kawaii anime grill images
* (Kind of) Responsive design
* Lots of stupidly labeled links
* Easy to edit with your own links
* Now with far less spaghetti code! (Thanks Avail)
* Lots of searchbars (Google, nyaa.se, YouTube and TPB)
* Easily customizable two color design

# Installation (in Firefox):
* Write 'about:config' in your adress bar to reach your advanced settings.
* Find 'browser.newtab.url'
* Set the value to the local path to the index.html file
* Open a new tab and be happy!
